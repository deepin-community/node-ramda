Description: practical functional library for JavaScript programmers
 A library designed specifically for a functional programming style, one that
 makes it easy to create functional pipelines, one that never mutates user data.
 .
 The primary distinguishing features of Ramda are:
  * Ramda takes the function first, and the data last
  * Ramda methods are automatically curried
 .
 Node.js is an event-based server-side JavaScript engine.
